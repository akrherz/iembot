I am a XMPP client with limited bot capabilities.  In general, I am a message
router more than anything.

An ancient version of this codebase runs the `nwsbot` instance within
[NWSChat](https://nwschat.weather.gov).  This codebase is currently used by the
`iembot` instance within [Weather.IM](https://weather.im).  This code got a major
refactoring during July 2018 and may be a bit more usable for others.

For examples of start scripts, see `iembot` within [Weather.IM codebase](https://github.com/akrherz/weather.im/tree/master/iembot).

Requires and tested on Python 3.8 through 3.10.
